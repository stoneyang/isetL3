Modifications made to the core L3 codes

1, ideal sensor and design sensor
Change to only have one design sensor, and then use a function to decrease the design sensor to a monochrome sensor, which is combined with the ideal filters to be the ideal sensor

2, analog gain and the offset
substract any agalog gain and the offset before training and rendering

3, empty filters management
delete all the empty filters after the training
